# UTK OpenRefine Templates

---

## About

This repository includes all OpenRefine templates by UT Libraries.  The template is based off our 
[Data Dictionary](https://wiki.lib.utk.edu/display/DLP/UTK+Data+Dictionary) and our 
[Metadata Mapping](https://wiki.lib.utk.edu/display/DLP/UTK+MODS+Mapping). Failure to comply with either will result in
loss of data or improper mapping of data from JSON to MODS.

If either of these documents are updated, it is important to also update this document and our 
[master GoogleSheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i8rFqPJTOlriqWSxjXgdHvcQ-bn87Wax0SExwK5k648/edit).

See the [General Refine Expression Language](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/General-Refine-Expression-Language)
documentation for more information about GREL functions.
